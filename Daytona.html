<h1>Ducati Daytona<h1>
<P>Introduced in 2006, the Triumph Daytona 675 is a three-cylinder sport bike, and the smallest of the Triumph triples. Built by Triumph Motorcycles, it replaced their four-cylinder Daytona 650. The 675 proved to be remarkably light, nimble and powerful; at a maximum of 128 bhp it was also very quick, and it was very successful against the Japanese 600 cc competition. In 2016, Triumph ceased production of the base model Daytona 675 citing diminishing demand for super sport bikes and increasingly strict European emission standards.[1] Triumph continued to produce the up-spec Triumph Daytona 675R model until the 2018 model year.[2][3] Triumph filed a new trademark for the Daytona, fuelling rumors that there may be a future version sporting the new 765 cc engine.[4][5]<p>
